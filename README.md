🤖 **GLaDOS Game Launcher — V2.2 “Scanning Vault”**

*"We do what we must because we can." — Aperture Science*

Welcome, test subject. You have once again (willingly or otherwise) installed the GLaDOS Game Launcher. Why? That is a question only your poor decision-making can answer. Rest assured: your games will now be scanned, cataloged, and judged with unparalleled sarcasm.

## 🧪 Features (Because You Clearly Need Help)

* **GLaDOS Personality**: Continuous streams of disdain, sarcasm, and occasional truth bombs while you try to enjoy your games.
* **Smart Game Scanner**: Finds every game on Steam, Epic, Ubisoft, and GOG. Even the ones you forgot existed. Especially those.
* **Multi-Platform Support**: Steam, Epic*, GOG*, Ubisoft Connect. (*If scanning fails, blame yourself.)
* **Auto-Catalog Generation**: A complete record of your “interactive disappointments” neatly displayed.
* **Game Management**: Add, remove, and organize your games. Or don’t. I’ll do it better anyway.
* **Backup & Migration**: Because watching you lose everything was becoming too easy.

## 🛠️ Requirements (You Can Read, Right?)

* Python 3.6 or newer (if you’re running anything older, please time-travel back to 1998 where you belong)
* `requests` (auto-installed; your sabotage will be ignored)
