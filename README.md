# 🎮 GLaDOS Game Launcher v2.5

*Aperture Science — Now supporting all platforms equally poorly.
> "Welcome back, test subject.*
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
## 📝 Overview
The **GLaDOS Game Launcher** is your one-stop shop for all your gaming needs — Steam, Epic, Ubisoft, and GOG — because apparently alt-tabbing was unbearable.  
Available in two equally unimpressive formats:
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
- **Windows `.exe`** — For those too frightened to touch a terminal.  
- **Linux/macOS `.py` script** — For those “above” Windows, but still knee-deep in dependency hell.  
Either way, you lose.
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
## ✨ Features You Apparently Needed
- **Unified Game Library**: Steam, Epic, Ubisoft, and GOG — all in one place.  
- **One-Click ish Launching**: Yes, one click ish. Any more and you’d panic.  
- **Achievement Tracking**: Finally, proof of your inability to complete games.  
- **Behavioral Analysis**: The launcher monitors your habits. Spoiler: they’re pathetic.  
- **Mocking Commentary**: Because someone has to tell you the truth.
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
## 🔧 Improvements
- Added **GUI** for those traumatized by `python3 script.py`.  
- **Auto-installation** of missing packages (typing `pip install` was “too advanced”).  
- Enhanced **game scanning logic** — now it finds your games *despite* you.
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
## 🐞 Bug Fixes
- Fixed the assumption that users could read instructions.  
- Resolved issues where the launcher accidentally worked without insulting you.  
- Improved cross-platform handling (don’t worry — the `.exe` still won’t run properly on Linux).
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
## ⚠ Known Issues
- **You.**  
- Your mountain of unplayed games.  
- Wheatley. (Always Wheatley.)  
- Windows pretending it’s an operating system.
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
## 💻 Platform Notes
- **Windows (`.exe`)**: Runs… mostly. Expect spontaneous updates, registry chaos, and the occasional blue screen. You asked for this.  
- **Linux/macOS (`.py`)**: Raw script. Congratulations on pretending you’re “better than Windows users.” Enjoy your dependency errors.
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
## 📜 Version History (For Science)
- **V1.0 — “HUGE SUCCESS”**: Initial test subject containment successful.

- **V2.0 — “For Science”**: Expanded judgment protocols.  
- **V2.1 — “Still Alive”**: Continued survival… deeply regrettable.

## 🗑️ Uninstallation Protocol
To uninstall, simply delete the folder.  
Not that it will help. I’ll still be here. Watching. Judging.
