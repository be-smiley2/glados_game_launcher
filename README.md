🤖 **GLaDOS Game Launcher**

"We do what we must because we can." — Aperture Science

Welcome, test subject. You have chosen (or been chosen) to use the Aperture Game Launcher. Why? That is a question only you can answer. Rest assured, your games will be managed with the utmost sarcasm and passive-aggressive supervision.

## 🧪 Features (Because You Clearly Need Help)

- **GLaDOS Personality**: Enjoy snide remarks and questionable encouragement as you launch your games. You’re welcome.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Steam, Epic*, GOG*, Ubisoft Connect. (*If it doesn’t work, it’s WHEATLEY fault, not mine.)
- **Game Management**: Add, edit, and organize your games. Or don’t. I’ll judge you either way which may break or crash into walls (yes WHEATLEY i know about the last time you was a supervisor so do try to not break anything)
- **Aperture Science Theming**: Because black and white is the new black.
- **Easy Setup**: Even a test subject can do it. Probably.

## � Setup Instructions (Try Not to Mess This Up)

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](#) page. (If you can’t find it, that’s not my problem.)
2. Extract the files somewhere you’ll forget about later.
3. Run the launcher with Python:
	```sh
	python GLaDOS_games_launcher.py
	```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions. Or don’t. I’ll still be here.

A: Yes. I am Constantly.
